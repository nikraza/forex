### Comment

Entered a couple of hours before London open on the news of British PM's [defeat](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-suffers-historic-defeat-as-tories-turn-against-her) in Brexit vote. GBP was expected to rise.

The trade went sideways for some time and then up when London opened.

Got out by TP.
